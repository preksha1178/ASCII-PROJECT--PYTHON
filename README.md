# ASCII-PROJECT--PYTHON
The ASCII Art Project is a Python-based console tool that converts characters, words, numbers, and alphabet ranges into large stylized ASCII art. It uses predefined patterns, fast keypress navigation, and optional rainbow or single-color output for each letter, making the tool interactive, simple, and visually creative.
